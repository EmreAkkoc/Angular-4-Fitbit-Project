# Angular 4 Fitbit Project

An Angular 4 app that allows the user to graph their heartrate during sleep and determines of what type the sleep was.

## Authentication

The app uses OAuth2 and tokens in order to authenticate and pull data from the Fitbit API. On first use, the app will prompt the user to login to their Fitbit account and authorise the app.
